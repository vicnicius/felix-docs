# Welcome

Welcome to the Felix Knowledge Center, where you can learn everything about the Felix platform. From the basic concepts to the more intricate technical details, our goal is to support you getting the most value out of Felix.

This is a living document, and we are constantly updating it with new content. If you have any questions or suggestions, please reach out to us at [support@felixapp.xyz](mailto:support@felixapp.xyz).

### Getting Started

We recommend starting with the [Felix Overview](/getting-started/overview) section to get a high-level understanding of the platform. From there, you can dive into the more detailed sections that interest you the most.
